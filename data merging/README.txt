For EMG and mediapipe data merging, four MATLAB scripts were created.

Run them in this order:

- timestampconversion
- mediapipetsconversion
- stamp_bridge
- step_function
- postprocessing


In MATLAB, at the top of the first two scripts, you can add
the name of the EMG or mediapipe data file on the first line.
